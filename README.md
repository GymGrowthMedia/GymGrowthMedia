# OVO RedSun — Interactive Hero (No Video)

This build replaces the hero video with a **canvas-based interactive background**:
- Glowing orange blobs drift and react to **mouse** and **scroll** (Webflow-like).
- Keeps the same sections: hero, strip, work grid, studio split, contact, footer.
- Netlify form enabled.

## Deploy
- Drag this folder to Netlify or push to GitHub (Netlify auto-deploys).

## Edit
- Structure → `index.html`
- Styles → `styles.css`
- Interactions → `scripts.js` (see the `// Interactive HERO canvas` block).
