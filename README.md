# TURA‑Lite (Minimal Dark Portfolio)

A lightweight one-page site inspired by the “TURA” shots you shared. Built for quick deployment on **Netlify**.

## Structure
- `index.html` – markup with 3 sections (Hero, Projects, Contact)
- `styles.css` – dark theme + layout
- `script.js` – smooth scrolling
- `assets/` – placeholder images + favicon

## Deploy (Netlify)
1. Zip this folder or push it to a GitHub repo.
2. On Netlify: **Add new site** → **Deploy manually** (drag the zip) or **Import from Git** (select the repo).
3. Done. The contact form uses a simple HTML form. To collect submissions on Netlify, keep the `netlify` attribute on the `<form>` tag and enable forms in site settings.

## Customize
- Replace `assets/placeholder-*.jpg` with your project shots.
- Edit text (brand, links, contact info) in `index.html`.
- Colors and spacing live in `styles.css` (CSS variables at the top).
